### 2017-1 Discrete Mathematics programming assignment  

Implement the following functionalities using your favorite programming language.  
 
1. The program should have the following menu as below (at the least).  Details of each menu/function is explained follows.  
 a. Create a set  
 b. Show elements of a set  
 c. Create a Cartesian product of two sets  
 d. Create a relation between two sets  
 e. Check if a relation is an Equivalence relation  
 
2. Detailed functionalities:  
(1) Menu – a: Create a finite set that is consisted of positive integers and give it a name (also include the empty set).  
E.g.:  
< Enter set name: A  
< Enter elements (repeat until finished)  …  
(2) Menu – b: Show elements of a set.  
E.g.:  
 < Enter set name: A  
 { 1 2 3 4 5 }  
(3) Menu – c: Create a Cartesian product for two sets.  
E.g.:  
 < Enter set name 1: A  
 < Enter set name 2: B  
 < Enter name of Cartesian product: C  
C = { (1 1) (1 2) (2 1) (2 2) }  
(4) Menu – d: Create a relation by entering a finite number of pairs  
E.g.:  
 < Enter name of relation: R1  
 < Enter pairs (repeated): 9, 8 …  
 < R1 = { (9, 8), … }  
(5) Menu – e: Determine if a relation is an equivalence relation or not.  
E.g.:  
< Enter: R1  
< Result: YES (or NO) 
 
Note: You can you any input methods or data structures you like.
 
3. Example run – provide a screen dump or even a movie of a simple program run.  
 
To submit: Source codes (make it runnable on my computer, include any libraries needed) and movies/screen dumps (No run – no points).
